The QSig Commission is an informally organized group of academic and industry researchers which is working on Quantum-1‚ÄêShot-Signatures (Q1Ss). Our interests are the following:

- Solve some theoretical problems in the Q1S research, such as if non-collapsing, collision resistant hash functions exist;
- Prove open questions around the security of Q1S;
- Work on Q1S implementations;
- Estimate the amount of quantum resources needed for a given implementation;
- Simplify implementations to make them consume as little resources as possible.

We work at the intersection between quantum cryptography and Web3, since Q1S may have a big impact on the architecture of consensus protocols. More broadly, we are interested in a wide range of applications of quantum computing to Web3, such as making Web3 protocols quantum resistant.

We are mainly active on [Github](https://github.com/The-QSig-Commission/), where we also have a [Wiki](https://github.com/The-QSig-Commission/QSigCommissionWiki/wiki). The difference between the Wiki and the blog is in the level of formality. Here, you can expect reports about ideas and works-in-progress, whereas the Wiki includes bibliographic resources and more stratified knowledge.
